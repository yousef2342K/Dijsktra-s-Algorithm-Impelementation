# Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

This project implements **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, a fundamental graph algorithm used to find the **shortest path** from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It is particularly useful for solving routing and network optimization problems.

## Features

1. **Shortest Path Calculation**  
   Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest paths efficiently.

2. **Weighted Graph Support**  
   Supports graphs with positive edge weights.

3. **User-Friendly Input**  
   Allows users to define custom graphs and source nodes.

4. **Visualization of Results**  
   Outputs the shortest path distances for all nodes in the graph.
